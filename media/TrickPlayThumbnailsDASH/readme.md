## Standard-thumbnail file creation

Roku has developed resources for producing standard-thumbnail tile files and playlists for DASH. This section describes those resources and their use.

### Mac prerequisites and installation

The following utility applications are needed:

- ffmpeg: version 4.3.1-skyzyx
- ImageMagick 7.0.10-7 Q16 x86_64 2020-04-20, montage utility
- python v3.8.5 (optional)

### Mac usage

Three Roku-provided scripts each do one task to build playlists.

1. `gen_thumbs.sh`: uses ffmpeg to generate thumbnails from a stream `.mp4` or `.m3u8`, this script uses very simple ffmpeg options to generate thumbnails at fixed intervals.
2. `gen_tiles.sh`: uses thumbnails generated in `gen_thumbs.sh`, and "assembles" them into a tile using the montage command from ImageMagick, e.g. 5x4 tiles.
3. `gen_manifest.sh`: uses the tiles generated in `gen_tiles.sh` and outputs the image manifest excerpt, the output image manifest excerpt has to entered into the master manifest.

All three scripts must be run in sequence, which the `run_scripts_dash.sh` file does.

An optional python3 script get_thumbid.py is available to parse DASH xml and set image adaptationSet id

The following command generates 320x180 thumbnails and 5x4 tiles with 10 second intervals:

```
$ ./run_scripts_dash.sh master.mpd tile 256x144 5 4 10
```

Finally, the image manifest excerpt generated by the `run_scripts` commands should be entered into the master manifest, as so:

```
  <AdaptationSet id="3" mimeType="image/jpeg" contentType="image">
    <SegmentTemplate media="$RepresentationID$/tile_$Number$.jpg" duration="80" startNumber="1"/>
      <Representation bandwidth="24000" id="thumbnails_256x144" width="1280" height="576">
        <EssentialProperty schemeIdUri="http://dashif.org/guidelines/thumbnail_tile" value="5x4"/>
      </Representation>
  </AdaptationSet>
```
